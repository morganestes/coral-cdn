This plugin enables using the Coral Content Distribution Network to speed up your website.

== Description ==

Content Delivery/Distribution Networks help speed up a website by loading assets from multiple sources around the Internet. [CoralCDN](http://www.coralcdn.org/) provides a free network of servers to help website owners easily offload resources to improve the performance of the site.

This plugin automatically enables the network for images added to a post or page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `coral-cdn.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Upload images in your posts and pages just like always.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work? =

CoralCDN works by appending `.nyud.net` to any assets you want to speed up.
The plugin works by rewriting the siteâ€™s URL for any images you upload when editing a post.

= Can I use this for CSS/JS files? =

Not yet, but I'm working on that.
